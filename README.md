## What This Plugin Is
This is a plugin for [homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge). It allows for management of the [Philips Somneo HF3670/60](https://www.usa.philips.com/c-p/HF3670_60/smartsleep-connected-sleep-and-wake-up-light). Additionally, it provides sensor data from the clock.

2. Install the `Homebridge Somneo` plugin and use the form to enter your configuration.

### Manual Installation

1. Install this plugin using: `sudo npm install -g homebridge-somneo --unsafe-perm`.
2. Edit `config.json` manually to add your information. See below for instructions on that.

#####Configuration Parameters Note
Due to the way that the Config UI X visual editor works, in order to not force users to write to their config file when they actually want to use an accessory, the boolean values can either be a literal boolean of `true` or a string boolean of `"true"`.


#### Config Example

```json
{
  "platforms": [
    {
      "name": "Homebridge Somneo",
      "host": "10.0.0.24",
      "platform": "HomebridgeSomneo"
    }
  ]
}
```


## Future Plans
- Currently the plugin only supports one Somneo clock. Not sure how many people have multiple clocks.
- Support for more accessories. I would love to add a switch to turn on the FM radio or AUX, but can't find that. Any help would be appreciated.
- No support for sound sensor. HomeKit does not have a sound level sensor. I thought about having an occupancy sensor, but would need to know what sound level occupied/not should be considered.
- Better error handling. I am a Java developer by trade and am still learning Typescript :).
